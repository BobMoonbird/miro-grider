# Grider
Grider simplifies the creation of widgets
in a grid of variable shapes and sizes.
It has simple preview and editor,
drag & drop support and multiple configuration options.

## Why Vanilla JS?
The use of plain Vanilla JS is intentional as I wanted to test whether it's
still (or already?) possible to create something useful without all the
shiny modern JS libraries.

I guess it's completely possible and pleasant enough,
but I'd still rather choose a ready made library for the time being.
